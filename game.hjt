Even if Nesterin is no longer an important silver mining town, its main square is still impressive. Many of the shops seem to have gone out of business, but the buildings still look rich and elegant, and around the @fountain some @people are chatting quietly on the @benches. The southern gate can be seen from here. There's a inn to the east, and large roads to the west and north seem to lead further into the town.

{fountain: The fountain is small but elegant, although you can see that it is not in perfect condition.}

Although not as large as the main square, it is even more amazing. Every @building around it is made of stone, and there's a huge white @statue in the centre, representing a man holding a strange @instrument.
If you go south from here, you can head towards the entrance to the city, while if you go east, you'll reach the governor's quarters.
{buildings:Most of the buildings in this place are banks, or loan offices.}
{statue:The statue is very tall and rests on a massive square base covered with @inscriptions. The man depicted is supposed to be one of the founders of the city.}

This beautiful square with a huge @fountain leads to the Governor's Palace. Even if his role after the invasion is just to follow orders and collect taxes, the invaders didn't remove him, but they did add @guards from their ranks. 
To the east is the @prison, while to the west is the square with the statue. From here you can also see in the distance the Northern gate.

The market square is relatively small, with stalls selling a variety of @food and @clothes, but few customers seem to be able to buy anything. From here it's possible to walk to the entrance of the town, which lies to the east. To the north, there's a @building that catches your eye because of its boarded-up door.

{building: It's a big building, with boarded-up doors.}

{food: The food on display is expensive and looks mediocre. There are lots of vegetables, some cheese and herbs, but very little @meat}

{clothes: The clothes are well made, although they look second-hand. There are also a few elegant garments and a @uniform too}

{uniform: Uniform is different from the one you've seen around on local guards. But it's close.}

{meat: It's mainly pork, but there's also some small wild animal.}

{foodseller: The food seller is a blond woman, middle-aged. She seems nice.}

{foodseller.talk: "Hello young boy, do you want something?", she asks smiling, but the smile vanishes as soon as you admit you've no money.}

{clothessalesman: The clothes saleswoman is an old lady, with a sad face.}

{clothessalesman.talk: "Hello, is there anything you like?", she asks, without too many expectations.}

The corridor on the first floor is clean and tidy, and there are several @rooms most of them with solid @doors.The place's mining past when rich merchants slept here during their business travels, is clearly over, but the owner still tries to keep everything as nice as it was.

{rooms: You count eight rooms, the first ones less posh but bigger, the last ones, located on the east side, a bit smaller.}

{doors: On the solid doors there are numbers. The first numbers are on the west side, last ones are on the east side. All the others are in front of you, south.}

This is a far cry from an ordinary inn room, and now it's probably just a shadow of what it should have been in better days. 
There are several signs of time on the @furniture, but even the @bed is much better than your master's.

{bed: The bed has a simple straw @mattress but the sheets and pillows are clean and comfortable.}

This forest of tall @trees and a few small @animals seems to be full of well-trodden @paths, surrounded by rich @vegetation, but after a while, most of them just stop, and the feeling of not knowing where to go grows. You get the impression that if you're not lost yet, you will be soon.
{trees: There are several different types of trees, all tall and wide}
{animals: From time to time you see a few @rabbits}
{vegetation: This forest is full of very diverse @plants, some of which are also very colorful}

This part of the forest, with also smaller @trees, looks a little different from the one just outside the town, but it is just as difficult to find your way around because of all the absurdly well-trodden @paths. You just keep on walking, feeling like you are going in circles. You will certainly need some hints on how to deal with this.

{paths: The paths begin and end without leading anywhere. Probably traces of trails erased by time.}

{trees: Some trees around you seem to have long @branches.}

{branches: Some of them are long and also flexible.}

{house: The house is certainly ancient, but nature doesn't seem to have taken any serious hold of it.}

{walls: Solid stone walls. The grass on it seems to follow patterns, instead of simply covering the most exposed parts.}

The first room you encounter, despite the large @windows, seems lit by a winter sky. There is a @fireplace, in front of a table with a @bottle and a @glass half-filled, a bookcase filled with @books, and above it, a @painting of an elderly woman with no eyes. Everything looks as if it has just been abandoned.

{windows: It probably depends on dirty glasses, but what you see from here doesn't look like the landscape outside. It's scary, and you stop looking through it almost immediately.}

{fireplace: It's unlit, but there are half-burnt logs and ashes.}

{painting: It's not hard to believe that she was called a witch if the woman in the painting is the owner of this place. Her eyes are carved and she's an unsettling smile.} 

{bottle: The bottle is almost empty. Just a few drops are left, but considering the smell, it contained what's now in the glass.}

Down a narrow staircase, you enter a large hall, dimly lit by cracks in the stone ceiling. Again, the floor is littered with debris, and the only thing that seems intact is what looks like an @altar in the center. All around you can see @openings, dark, leading to no one knows where.
{openings: You can hear horrible, deep sounds in the distance, and nothing in the world will convince you to enter them.}

The @tunnels seem to go on forever, descending gently down the mountain. From time to time you'll see @crossroads with @markings you can't understand, so you're not sure which way to go. 
{markings:You cannot understand them, but they have common elements. Maybe they're names, or indications.}
{crossroads:There's a crossroad each few hundred steps. This place is a labyrinth.}
{tunnels:You've never seen tunnels so large and dug out so regularly.}

This large room seems to be the heart of the entire tunnel system. There are @inscriptions and complex @drawings on the walls, a kind of @forge in the centre and, on one side, atop a stand, a strange elongated @instrument.
